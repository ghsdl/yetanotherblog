# YAB stands for Yet Another Blog

This one is a tiny bit more complex than the previous html projects. It's about a fake blog for the danish brand LEGO.

This has been deployed on surge for the fun of it, you can find it here: https://yab.surge.sh

# stack

i am not yet finished with my back to basics series if i can say so myself. It's still html and css.

# what i thought would happen

- thinking about the design
- choosing when to use flex and when to use grid, decide what is the best way to use them
- exploring a bit more css 

# what actually happened

- playing with grid was actually fun even though i don't quite handle it as well as flex yet
- really love the hover effect on the button 

# what i learned from this project 

- grid can be accurate in some cases and we should remember to use it instead of maybe flexing too many boxes
- hover effect is a nice touch generally, im getting better with :before and :after
- position sticky is actually quite easy to use and effective in some cases
